Hello Dearest Reader! My name is Henry, and I am a Philosophy, Politics and Economics student at UCL It is wonderful that you have stumbled down the rabbit hole that has brought you to this blog, a repository for my analysis of and reflections on a wide range of current events and issues.

If you are wondering why I made the decision to build a website and write a blog then allow me to explain (if you aren’t wondering, then please do continue to the next article).  In 2020 the news and media landscape is as diverse as it ever has been; however, I believe that finding paywall free, high-quality, rigorous analysis can often be far too difficult. My goal in establishing this blog is to contribute to important debates with some analysis of my own, but more importantly providing an entry point into more in-depth discussions and debates.

New habits are often the hardest to establish so it seems sensible to establish some ground rules for this new blog. Firstly, everything I discuss will be completely open source. All the data, code, references that I use will be available for you, dear reader, to copy to your heart’s delight and available from my GitHub page. If you do choose to use anything that I have written, all I ask is that you reference me in anything that you publish (not that I would expect anything less from a dear reader like your good self). I love the openness of the programming and coding community and hope to contribute to it in my own small way. Secondly, I want to make sure to satiate your appetite for content, so I am planning on publishing one article per month (likely in the first week of the month) as well as one comment piece per month. Finally, dear reader, I encourage you to play an active part in the development of this blog. If that means sharing these articles, posting a comment or providing your own piece of criticism in your response, then I value any (friendly!) contributions.

Welcome to the journey!
